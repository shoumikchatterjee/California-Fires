# California-Fires 

These files showcase my graphical abilities, specifically regression, scatter, and circle/bubble plots.  

The graphs file shows the temperature ranges and humidities of three major fires during December 2017 as well as multiple charts to display that linear regression does not capture the increasing human and property devastations due to the fires from 2010 to 2017.

The circles file displays colorful circles of fires that started during December 2017 centered at their onset temperatures and humidities.

The plots file has one scatterplot showing acres burned in three southern California counties and one bar graph showing the fires reported categorized by three different humidity levels.
